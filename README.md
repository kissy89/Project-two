Project 2 during Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack, Barcelona

Niubee should provide insights from locals in a city. Locals can register on the app and share their so-called secrets
(places they love to go and recommend it to others). Target group is everybody who recently moved to this city.

First version (and the project 2 presentation product) includes Barcelona, more cities can be added.

Google API is used to make it easier to find places (establishments, geolocations)

Future improvements (in progress):
  - improve loading response
  - file upload (at first for profile pictures)
  - responsiveness (currently mobile first, using CSS and SASS)
  - at the moment the app is made during module 2 (backend focussed) - so using React will be better for UI, UX in general
